    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    Hi, I'm Rob. I'm a web applications developer from Nottingham, England.
    </p>
    <p>
    I graduated from the
    <a href="http://www.nottingham.ac.uk">University of Nottingham</a> in July
    of 2011, with a first-class honours degree in Computer Science.
    </p>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>
    I'm usually working on at least one project, so check out my
    <a href="https://github.com/robgolding63">GitHub Page</a> to see what I'm
    up to at the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
    Most recently, I developed an open source continuous backup system for my
    third-year project at university.
    It's designed to be hosted in-house, for small and medium businesses. The
    code is licensed under the GPL, and can be found at the project's
    <a href="http://github.com/robgolding63/backtrac/">GitHub page</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Work</h2>
    <p>
    I am currently working as a application developer in Leicester. My work is
    based around the
    <a href="http://djangoproject.com/">Django web framework</a>, but also
    involves any or all of the following: Git, Gunicorn, nginx, MySQL, Celery,
    RabbitMQ, Redis, StatsD, Graphite.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the operations field, I have experience working with both Windows and
    Linux systems. Particularly, I write automation scripts in languages like
    PowerShell and Python.
    </p>
    <p>
