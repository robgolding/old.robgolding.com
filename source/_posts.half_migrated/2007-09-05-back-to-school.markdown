Well the first day of my last year at "school" is over - which is actually 6th form. Now I'll have much less time to spend on the IT side of things - which is disappointing. Just when lots of work comes my way!

It's not all bad though. The school seems to have gone all-out with it's IT spending this year, which is obviously a huge bonus to the new students (and us old ones as well!). We have new study areas, and new "flagship" IT labs, with brand-spanking Dells. Brilliant! I just hope the ancient AD infrastructure can support the hundred odd new machines. At least they have a real network manager now, so I won't be drafted in to sort things out when someone decides to seize the Schema Master role from a running server :(.
