The new core switch that was due to arrive has finally come, with no real
delays which is surprising, since it was sent using Royal Mail. The new Netgear
has really good management features, and the web interface is pretty detailed.
Most of all though, I'm enjoying the ability to have a few VLANs, and
a reasonable amount of traffic without the thing crashing on me every five
minutes (thanks Planet).

I'm going to be doing some bandwidth testing soon as well, just to see what
kind of speeds I'm getting, but I'm expecting it to do fine.
