[![](http://www.ubuntu.com/files/countdown/810/c_brown/countdown_8_10_c_00_days_a_here.png "Ubuntu 8.10 - Its Here")](http://www.ubuntu.com/)The next incarnation of the Ubuntu linux distribution came out at the end of this week, and whilst typing this post, I am upgrading my laptop's operating system. Unfortunately, I was unable to upgrade in the way that is described on the website [here](http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading "Upgrading to Ubuntu 8.10"), instead my update manager seemed to think that the system was completely up-to-date, even after multiple refreshes. Therefore, I'm just upgrading the old-school way, by running the following commands:


sudo apt-get update




sudo do-release-upgrade



So, hopefully the improvements to gnome, and the new Dust theme will go down a treat when the upgrade's finished. Personally I'm looking forward to the new BBC iPlayer integration with Totem, Ubuntu's media player - and hoping for some improvements to Microsoft Exchange connectivity within Evolution, the mail client.

I shall keep the world up-to-date, as this journey continues!
