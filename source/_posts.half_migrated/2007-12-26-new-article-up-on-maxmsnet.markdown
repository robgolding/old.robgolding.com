For the first time in 7 months, I've finished writing a new article for my resource site - [maxms.net](http://www.maxms.net "maxms.net Windows Server/Exchange Resource Site"). The article is entitled **<span class="article-title">Folder Redirection with Group Policy in Server 2003</span>**<span class="article-title"> - it's purpose should be explained fully in the title!</span>

If this helps just one person out there, I will be happy. I'd be even happier if they contacted me to let me know it helped :). I hope this will signal a revival for the site, and I shall continue writing more articles as time allows. Any suggestions for future articles are welcome, just shoot me an email with the contact button up top.

For a direct link to the article, and some shameless self-promotion:  [**<span class="article-title">Folder Redirection with Group Policy in Server 2003</span>**](http://maxms.net/article/Folder-Redirection-with-Group-Policy-in-Server-2003 "Folder Redirection with Group Policy in Server 2003")<span class="article-title"></span>
