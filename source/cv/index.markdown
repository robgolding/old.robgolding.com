As previously mentioned, I have experience working with both Windows and Linux
systems, and I am a skilled programmer. Also, I have an in-depth knowledge of
the Django framework, and very much enjoy writing web applications using it.

I graduated from The University of Nottingham, England in July 2011, and am
open to offers of employment in and around the Nottingham area.

My full CV, in PDF format, is available [here][cv].
