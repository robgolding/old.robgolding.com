As previously mentioned, I have experience working with both Windows and Linux
systems, and I am a skilled programmer. Also, I have an in-depth knowledge of
the Django framework, and very much enjoy writing web applications using it.

I graduated from The University of Nottingham, England in July 2011, and am
open to offers of employment anywhere in the UK.

My CV is available in both [HTML][cv-html] and [PDF][cv-pdf] format.

[StackOverflow Careers][socareers].
