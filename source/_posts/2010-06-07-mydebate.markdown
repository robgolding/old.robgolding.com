[django-radius](https://github.com/robgolding63/django-radius/ "django-radius")
is, fairly obviously, a RADIUS authentication backend for Django. It's also a
little more than that, however. It allows you to authenticate against different
RADIUS servers depending on some condition (which you specify with your own
code). As a hint, it's pretty useful for cloud apps which might authenticate to
customer's systems.

For full details, see the
[documentation](https://github.com/robgolding63/django-radius/blob/master/README
.md "django-radius README").
