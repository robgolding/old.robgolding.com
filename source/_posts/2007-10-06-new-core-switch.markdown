title: New Core Switch

For a while now, I've been having problems with the network's core switch - it's
a [Planet FGSW-2620][planet]. Yes, I know, it's a Planet. My mistake in the
first place, it wasn't even worth the cheap price I paid for it. It crashes
almost every day, when the traffic level gets above approximately zero. To put
it lightly, it's a nightmare. Even the management is terrible - it can only be
managed by it's serial interface, has no web server, not even an IP - so there's
no SNMP, no Telnet, nothing.

Anyway, lets get onto the new switch, that will be arriving any day now. It's a
[Netgear FSM726][netgear], and it looks a damn sight better than this Planet
I've been running for a few months. I know it's no ProCurve, but it's got all
the functionality of a high level enterprise switch - all types of SNMP and
RMON, a web interface, Telnet, VLANS, the works. As long as I can monitor it
somewhat, and it doesn't crash all the time, I'll be happy. Plus it will make a
nice addition to the new server closet I've just moved into.
