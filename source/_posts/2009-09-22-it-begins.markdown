The country has just undergone a mass-exodus of university students from their
parents' houses back into halls. I played by own small part in blocking up the
roads moving back into university accommodation this weekend, and it's all
gearing up for the new school year.

I've been working with Django more and more lately, and I've written my first
"commercial" application using my new favourite framework - a booking system
for taught causes at the City Council. I'm really enjoying writing web
applications with Django, and I'm sure this blog will start to resemble
a web-developer's in the near future.

Also, I'm really looking forward to this year at university. As I understand
it, there's a lot more work to be done, but the software engineering group
project should be fun - as long as my "randomly chosen" team are happy with us
using Python!
