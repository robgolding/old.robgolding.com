It dawned upon me quite suddenly recently, that my site has been running this
same design ([Freshy 2](http://www.jide.fr/english/downloads/freshy2 "Freshy 2
Theme") by Jide) since it was brought online in late 2007. That, my friend, is
not acceptable!

So, I have been working on a totally new design, of my own creation this time.
The main site has already been changed over, and I'm working on themeing the
Wordpress install as we speak.

progress, check it out [here](/blog/?theme=robgolding "Preview the new
theme").</del> The new theme is now live on the site, I hope you like it!

I'll be sure to update you when it's complete. In the meantime however,
feedback, as always, is most welcome.

Update: The new design is now live! I'll still be working on it though, fixing
up any little niggles that are bound to crop up.
