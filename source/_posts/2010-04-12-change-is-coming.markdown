<script src="http://www.ubuntu.com/files/countdown/display.js"
type="text/javascript"></script> I'm sure that I am not the only one waiting for
the new release of Ubuntu - 10.04 Lucid Lynx.

My netbook has been in need of a reinstall for quite a while now, and this will
be the perfect opportunity - if only _slightly_ inconvenient that it falls right
in the middle of one of the busiest periods of the year for me!

I first expected that with 10.04 being a Long-Term Support (LTS) release, it
would be lighter on new features, and heavier on bugfixes and the like. That
doesn't seem to be the case, however, with a [healthy
list](http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/lucid/beta2#New%20features%20since%20Ubuntu%
209.10 "New Features in Ubuntu 10.04") of new stuff on the website. I'm most
looking forward to the faster boot times, as a slow boot often gets in my way
when I'm starting up at the beginning of a lecture.

What's your most anticipated new feature of Ubuntu 10.04?
