Nota is a Python application that
converts[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Markdown")
files to HTML, using[Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/ "Pandoc"), which
is a Haskell library for converting between markup formats.

It was originally created by[Robert Miles](http://www.robertskmiles.com "Robert
S. K. Miles"), and I turned it into a Python library (and also wrote a[Gedit
plugin](http://bitbucket.org/robgolding63/nota-gedit/ "Nota Gedit plugin"),
which has an extremely specific use).
